# React Native Phone App

We developed a mobile phone app that enables easier interface with the wearable patches ([link to Wearable Patches!](https://github.com/mohnikbakht/Cardio_Wearable_Patch)) for the user. The app is coded in React-Native. We chose React-Native to build a cross-platform native app for both iOS and Android.
